    title: "Systematic Task Mapping",
    iconName: "ListChecks",
    shortDesc: "Structure the interface around critical work tasks by mapping operational procedures into Guided User Tasks (GUTasks), incorporating checkpoints and performance feedback.",
    fullDescription: [
      "The user interface should be driven by a structured decomposition of real-world work activities into critical user tasks, ensuring that every interaction contributes to the training objectives. This guideline was ranked highest by experts, who emphasized the value of incorporating checkpoints and feedback mechanisms throughout the execution of Guided User Tasks (GUTasks).",
      "These interactions should also provide measurable evidence of user performance. Immediate feedback benefits not only trainees by reinforcing safe behaviors but also organizations by generating quantitative performance indicators that can support competency assessment and training management.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator uses a TaskManager system with ScriptableObjects that define each task and an instructional video. The training is divided into 10 sequential GUTasks: (1) energizing the lathe, (2) reading and interpreting the process sheet, (3) configuring panel levers, (4) setting rotation speed, (5) securing the test specimen in the chuck, (6) securing the cutting tool in the tool post, (7) closing safety locks, (8) starting the machine, (9) moving the carriage toward the specimen, and (10) pressing the emergency stop. Each task has a SubTaskTrigger that fires events upon completion, and the system displays the current and next task. The QuickOutline asset highlights objects relevant to the current subtask.",

    shortDesc: "Design interactions that minimize fatigue, excessive reach, prolonged arm elevation, abrupt camera movements, and cybersickness.",
    fullDescription: [
      "Ergonomic comfort is considered a fundamental design requirement. Although the original guideline focused on preventing fatigue and cybersickness, the discussion expanded this perspective by emphasizing that ergonomic decisions directly influence user performance, engagement, and training duration.",
      "Participants highlighted that prolonged arm elevation, excessive reaching, abrupt viewpoint changes, and repetitive interaction patterns should be minimized whenever possible. Ergonomic requirements vary according to the duration, objectives, and physical demands of each training scenario. Interface designers should balance realism with physical comfort, ensuring that interactions remain representative of real-world activities without imposing unnecessary physical strain.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator was developed for the latest VR glasses and the entire experience lasted less than 5 minutes. The foot pedal is operated via raycast against a static 3D model (since the user's foot is not tracked), avoiding the need to bend down. Smooth locomotion is used to reduce cybersickness.",

    title: "Spatial and Multimodal Coherence",
    iconName: "Layers",
    shortDesc: "Ensure that visual, auditory, haptic, and interactive feedback operate as complementary communication channels, supporting perception and situational awareness.",
    fullDescription: [
      "This topic emerged as one of the most prominent in both the reviewed literature and the Delphi discussions. Participants consistently agreed that visual, auditory, and haptic feedback should communicate complementary information while remaining seamlessly integrated into the virtual environment.",
      "Several experts emphasized that multimodal feedback becomes particularly important when hand tracking replaces physical controllers. Without the tactile confirmation provided by handheld devices, visual and auditory cues play a central role in communicating interaction outcomes and reducing uncertainty during task execution. Beyond improving interaction quality, multimodal feedback can also enhance accessibility by accommodating users with different perceptual abilities and interaction preferences.",
    ],
    latheExample: "In the lathe training simulator, when the user completes a task, the system emits sound effects, controller haptic feedback, and a UI displaying the current task as completed and the next one. When the user turns a lever, they receive auditory feedback (mechanical sound), haptic feedback (controller vibration), and visual feedback (lever animation + indicator light). The instructional video for each task is presented on a virtual monitor inside the environment, not as a floating menu.",

    title: "Guided Task Progression",
    iconName: "Footprints",
    shortDesc: "Provide structured onboarding and progressively introduce tasks, allowing users to master controls before entering complex or hazardous scenarios.",
    fullDescription: [
      "Experts highlighted the importance of an onboarding phase. The interface should require users to complete a simple interaction task before entering hazardous scenarios in order to verify control mastery.",
      "This recommendation extends the original guideline by emphasizing onboarding not only as a learning aid but also as an essential mechanism for distinguishing failures caused by inadequate interface interaction from those genuinely associated with task execution.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator is structured around two primary scenes. The tutorial scene contains UIs explaining system usage, allowing users to freely walk through the laboratory and experiment with tools without commencing the actual training. The main scene is where the actual training takes place, with the 10 guided GUTasks. This structure ensures that users master the controls before entering the hazardous scenario of operating a lathe.",

    fullDescription: [
      "This finding is closely linked to the spatial and multimodal coherence guideline, which led the experts' discussion toward the role of information management.",
      "Presenting only task-relevant information and distributing instructions across multiple sensory modalities reduces unnecessary cognitive effort.",
    ],
    latheExample: "In the lathe training simulator, only the current task is displayed on the UI. The instructional video is shown on a virtual monitor, the relevant object is highlighted with a green outline (QuickOutline), and feedback is given through sound and vibration, distributing information across multiple channels without overloading the visual field.",

    title: "Context-sensitive Realism",
    iconName: "Eye",
    shortDesc: "Prioritize functional realism by faithfully representing operational procedures, hazards, and decision-making processes instead of focusing solely on visual fidelity.",
    fullDescription: [
      "Realism does not need to be purely visual; it should help users understand the task, risks, and required decisions without introducing unnecessary details that increase cognitive load.",
      "Experts also suggested replacing floating menus with interfaces embedded directly into machinery or virtual tablets, as well as designing system responses that reflect unsafe actions.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator uses dimensionally accurate 3D modeling of the Clark CM41x1000 lathe and the Labusig laboratory at UFPR. The machine behavior replicates the real one. The realism is functional, focused on procedures and operational risks, not just visual fidelity.",

    shortDesc: "Adapt the interface to users' abilities, experience with VR, and individual characteristics by providing flexible interaction techniques, multimodal feedback, and inclusive design solutions.",
    fullDescription: [
      "Even though accessibility emerged implicitly throughout several discussions, such as in multimodal interaction, embodied interaction, and ergonomic comfort, the experts agreed that it should be represented as an independent design guideline.",
      "The panel argued that developers should accommodate differences in users' physical characteristics, perceptual abilities, previous experience with VR, and motor capabilities, enabling a broader range of users to successfully complete training activities.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator offers multiple interaction mechanisms: direct grab for objects, raycast for UI and foot pedal, and virtual physical buttons. The tutorial scene accommodates users with no prior VR experience. The foot pedal is accessible via raycast, accommodating users with mobility limitations. Multimodal feedback (visual, auditory, haptic) addresses different perceptual abilities. The system adapts to users' physical characteristics.",

    shortDesc: "Introduce gamified elements only when they reinforce learning objectives, motivation, and engagement without compromising realism or safety-oriented decision making.",
    fullDescription: [
      "Experts agreed that game mechanics can increase engagement, motivation, and training adherence, backed by scientific literature. However, they emphasized that gamification should never compromise the primary learning objectives or distort risk perception.",
      "Therefore, gamification was regarded as a context-dependent recommendation whose adoption should be determined according to the instructional goals and characteristics of each training scenario.",
    ],
    latheExample: "The lathe training simulator does not use traditional gamification (points, rankings, competition). The focus is on safety and learning the correct procedure. Task completion feedback (sound, UI, vibration) provides a sense of progress without distorting risk perception. The linear progression through the 10 tasks functions as a form of intrinsic 'progress.'",
